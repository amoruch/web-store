# web-store
Just web-store(as simple as possible).

Quite raw and not suitable for commercial purposes, but the project performs the main functions (except for payment).

Used technologies(kinda?):
- SQL
- JWT Authentication
- Flask api

This projects on my opinion have big problems with security, but in the near future i'll try my best and create a new brach special for fixing all security breaches.
